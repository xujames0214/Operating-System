# Oprating-System
This is the big project of WPI CS502(Operating System, fall 2017).  I modified the Fault Handler to deal with page faults, allocate frames for a process which tries to access to memory, and do page replacement if needed. I also implemented some system call functions to enable the operating system to define shared area in memory, send a message and receive a message in a process.
